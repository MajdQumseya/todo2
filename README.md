# todo-list


HTML/CSS/JS todo list task

General: create a todo list application using html/css/js.

Spec:

Have a list of tasks, sorted by add time.
At the end of the task list, add input box that accepts new task by ‘Enter’ key. Adding a new task should put the task at the end of the list and the input box should still appear after the whole list.
Each task should have a checkbox to indicate it’s status (done/open).
Ability to delete task.
Ability to sort by date, done/not done, alphabetical order.
Persistency: upon refresh, task list should appear.
CSS - design however you like


Submission:

Open a git repo for your todo list.
Work with branches and Pull Requests - every code that goes into master should be reviewed (set me as a reviewer).
Work with small commits. Pull requests should be relatively short to handle, with real value (Bug fixes, features, refractors).
You can still commit only a part of your work - this is why you are having your own branch.
Commit messages should be short and informative. ‘fixed bug’ is bad, ‘used array.filter to filter out an array and then check if the length is greater than 6 and then decide what to do’ is also bad. ‘fixed layout bug that happens when there are more than 6 items’ is short and informative.
Branches should have meaningful names - ‘add-task-bug-fix’ is much better that ‘branch32’.
